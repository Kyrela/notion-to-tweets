# notion-to-tweets

notion-to-tweets is a simple tool to convert markdown files generated by 
Notion to markdown files that can almost be copy/pasted to Twitter.

## Why?

I use Notion to write threads for Twitter. When I'm done, I want to be able to
split the thread into individual tweets and post them to Twitter easily.

## How?

1. Export your Notion page as a markdown file.
2. Run
   ```bash
   python3 notion_to_tweets.py -f <downloaded file>
   ```
3. Copy/paste the content of the file `tweets.md` to Twitter.

## Usage

```
usage: notion_to_tweets.py [-h] -f FILE [-o OUTPUT]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  path to input file
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        path to output file
```
